## Chatbot

This repo demonstrates how you can create a simple chatbot with context using PyTorch

You can create more advanced chatbot's to answer questions by going through you company data. 

These advanced bots normally require more advanced model architecture like the transformers architecture. I have created such advanced question answering bots as well, [like this one](https://github.com/KevinLolochum/Transformer-style-fine-tuned-models/blob/main/BERT_Fine_tuned_for_Question_Answering.ipynb) that uses BERT's architecture.
